# Built By Tom - Project Notes & Context

## CRITICAL: Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Tom's Voice MUST BE:
- **Humble**: "I've been there" not "I know better"
- **Helpful**: Focus on solutions, not problems
- **Honest**: Direct without being harsh
- **Approachable**: Professional but not formal
- **Empowering**: Build confidence, don't create fear
- **Trust-building**: Realistic numbers and claims

### NEVER USE:
- Fear-mongering language ("Your competitors already won", "costing you customers")
- Aggressive CTAs ("Fix My Mess", "Stop the bleeding")
- Dismissive language about competitors or other solutions
- Overly casual/cocky phrases ("No BS", "Nuclear Option", "hell")
- Negative framing of client situations
- Inflated statistics or unrealistic claims

### ALWAYS USE:
- Solution-focused language ("Let's build something better")
- Educational tone in FAQs
- Respectful mentions of alternatives (Wix, competitors)
- Positive outcomes instead of negative consequences
- "We/Let's" language for partnership feel
- Realistic, believable numbers

## Copy Examples:

### BAD:
- "Your website is costing you customers"
- "Pick your poison"
- "Stop doing robot work"
- "Soul-crushing tasks"
- "Your competitors already won"
- "240% increase" (too specific/unbelievable)

### GOOD:
- "Let's get your website working for you"
- "Whether it's a broken website, endless tasks, or disconnected tools"
- "Automate repetitive tasks"
- "Complete Business Package"
- "Stand out in your market"
- "2x more reviews" (believable)

Tom is here to help small business owners succeed, not scare them into buying. Every piece of copy should feel like helpful advice from a friend who's been there, not a salesperson trying to close a deal.

## Sample/Demo Pages Philosophy

### Purpose:
- Show what's possible, not generic templates
- Each demo must feel PREMIUM - make business owners say "wow, I need this"
- Demonstrate both design excellence AND business-building features
- Use noindex tags to prevent SEO confusion

### Restaurant Demo Design:
- **Color Palette**: Deep Olive Green (#3B4A3F), Aged Terracotta (#A86754), Creamy Mascarpone (#F4F2ED), Espresso (#2D2A26), Saffron Gold (#DCA953)
- **Key Elements**: Chef story/heritage, visual gallery with filters, email club signup with incentive
- **Philosophy**: Emotional storytelling + visual sophistication + automation features = premium feel
- **Goal**: Not just a website demo, but a restaurant marketing consultation in visual form
