What to do if you already paid for a website you hate?
Practical steps to take when you're stuck with a website that's not working for your business.

You Paid for a Website You Hate. Now What?
So you dropped a few thousand on a website, and now you can't stand looking at it. Maybe it looked great in the mockups. Maybe the designer convinced you it was exactly what you needed.

But now? You avoid sending people to it. You mumble the URL. You know it's not helping your business, but you already paid for it.

I see this all the time. Here's what you can actually do about it.

First, Figure Out What's Really Wrong
Before you light it on fire and start over, let's get specific. Is it:

Just ugly? (Fixable)
Confusing to navigate? (Usually fixable)
Missing key information? (Easy fix)
Broken on phones? (Depends on the platform)
Not showing up on Google? (Almost always fixable)
Built on a platform you can't update? (Bigger problem)
Sometimes what feels like a total disaster just needs a few strategic fixes.

Check Your Contract (Seriously)
I know, nobody likes reading contracts. But check for:

Who owns the design files?
Do you have access to all accounts?
Are there any revision clauses?
What about hosting and domain ownership?
You'd be surprised how many people don't actually own their own website. If your designer holds the keys, you need those before doing anything else.

Don't Throw Good Money After Bad
Your first instinct might be to hire someone to "fix" it. But here's the thing - sometimes fixing a bad foundation costs more than starting fresh.

It's like renovating a house with rotten beams. Sure, you can patch it up, but you'll be dealing with problems forever.

Ask yourself:
Will fixes solve the core problems?
Is the platform limiting what you can do?
Are you just postponing the inevitable?
Your Real Options
Option 1: Strategic Updates Only
If the bones are good but the execution is off, focus on high-impact changes:

Rewrite the homepage copy
Add clear calls-to-action
Fix mobile responsiveness
Update photos and branding
Improve load speed
Option 2: Work With What You've Got
Not ideal, but if money's tight:

Use it as a simple business card site
Drive traffic to your Google Business Profile instead
Focus on social media for now
Save up for a proper rebuild later
Option 3: Cut Your Losses and Start Fresh
If the site is actively hurting your business, it might be time to move on. A bad website is worse than no website.

The good news? You've learned what you DON'T want. That's valuable.

How to Not Repeat This Mistake
Before you hire anyone else:

1. See Their Real Work
Not just portfolio pieces. Real client sites. Click around. Use them on your phone. Would you trust these sites?

2. Get Everything in Writing
Who owns what
What's included
Revision policies
Timeline and milestones
3. Start Small
Consider starting with a simple, clean site you can build on. You don't need every bell and whistle on day one.

4. Own Your Stuff
Your domain, hosting, design files - make sure you have access to everything. No exceptions.

The Silver Lining
That website you hate? It taught you exactly what you don't want. That's halfway to knowing what you do want.

Plus, web design has gotten better and cheaper. What cost $10,000 five years ago might cost $2,000 today - and work better.

Bottom Line
A bad website isn't a life sentence. You have options. The worst thing you can do is nothing - letting a terrible site turn away customers day after day.

Whether you fix it, work around it, or replace it, just don't let it sit there hurting your business. Your website should make you money, not cost you customers.

And next time? You'll know exactly what questions to ask before you write the check.
