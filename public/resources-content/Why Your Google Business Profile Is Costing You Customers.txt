# Why Your Google Business Profile Is Costing You Customers

*The free tool that can make or break your local business - and why most people get it completely wrong.*

## The Problem You Don't See Coming

You're losing customers before they even call you, and you don't even know it's happening.

Here's what's going on: someone searches for "plumber near me" or "best restaurant in [your town]." Your business shows up in the results. They click on your Google Business Profile to learn more.

And then they choose your competitor instead.

Not because their business is better. Not because their prices are lower. But because their Google Business Profile doesn't make them look like they went out of business in 2019.

## What Your Customers See (And Why They Leave)

### Wrong Hours = Lost Sales

**What you think:** "I'll update my hours when they change."

**What actually happens:** Someone drives to your restaurant at 7 PM on a Tuesday. Google says you're open until 9. You actually close at 6. They're standing outside your locked door, frustrated, and they're never coming back.

**The fix:** Check your hours every month. Set them correctly for holidays. If you're closed for vacation, mark it on your profile.

### No Photos = No Trust

**What you think:** "People can see what we look like when they get here."

**What actually happens:** People choose restaurants, salons, and service businesses based on photos. No photos means they assume you have something to hide.

**The fix:** Add real photos of your space, your team, your work. Not stock photos. Real ones. Even phone photos are better than nothing.

### Outdated Information = Professional Death

**What you think:** "I set this up three years ago, it should be fine."

**What actually happens:** Your phone number changed. Your address is wrong. Your services list is from 2020. People can't reach you, so they call your competitor instead.

**The fix:** Audit your profile every three months. Pretend you're a customer trying to contact you. Can you actually reach yourself?

### Generic Business Description = Invisible Business

**What you think:** "Quality service since 1995."

**What actually happens:** That tells customers nothing about what you actually do or why they should choose you.

**The fix:** Be specific. "Family-owned plumbing in North Haven. 24/7 emergency service, upfront pricing, licensed and insured." Now they know exactly what you offer.

## The Mistakes That Cost the Most Money

### Ignoring Reviews (Good and Bad)

**The mistake:** Someone leaves a 1-star review saying your service was terrible. You ignore it because responding feels awkward.

**Why it's expensive:** Everyone who reads that review sees that you don't care about your customers' experience.

**What to do:** Respond to every review. Thank people for good ones. Address concerns in bad ones professionally. Show that you actually care.

### Not Using Posts and Updates

**The mistake:** Treating your Google Business Profile like a static business card.

**Why it's expensive:** Google rewards active profiles with better visibility. Plus, customers want to see you're actually open and operating.

**What to do:** Post updates about new services, special offers, or even just "we're open and ready to help you today." Once a week is fine.

### Wrong Category Selection

**The mistake:** Picking a category that sounds more impressive than what you actually do.

**Why it's expensive:** Google shows your business to people searching for things you don't actually offer.

**What to do:** Pick the category that most accurately describes your primary service. You want the right customers, not more customers.

## How to Check If Yours Is Broken

**The 5-Minute Audit:**

1. Google your business name + your city
2. Look at your Google Business Profile like you're a potential customer
3. Call the phone number listed - does it work?
4. Check the address - is it correct?
5. Look at your hours - are they current?
6. Read your description - does it tell people what you actually do?
7. Scroll through your photos - do they make you look professional?

**Red flags that are costing you customers:**
- Hours that haven't been updated in over a year
- No photos or only stock photos
- Description that could apply to any business
- Address or phone number that's wrong
- Reviews you've never responded to

## The Free Fix That Pays for Itself

Here's the thing about Google Business Profile: it's completely free, but most businesses treat it like an afterthought.

Your competitors are probably making the same mistakes. Which means fixing yours gives you an instant advantage.

**Spend one hour this week:**
- Update your hours, phone, and address
- Add 5-10 real photos of your business
- Write a description that actually tells people what you do
- Respond to your recent reviews
- Add your services/menu if you haven't already

That one hour of work will pay for itself within a month. Guaranteed.

## What Happens When You Get It Right

When your Google Business Profile is dialed in:
- More people call you instead of your competitors
- Customers show up confident they're in the right place
- You look professional and trustworthy before anyone even meets you
- Google shows your business to more local searchers
- You stop losing customers to easily preventable mistakes

## The Bottom Line

Your Google Business Profile is often the first impression people have of your business. Make sure it's not the last.

Most business owners spend thousands on websites and ads while completely ignoring the free tool that local customers actually use to find them.

Don't be most business owners.
