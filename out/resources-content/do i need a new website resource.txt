Do I really need a new website?
Share:
Let's be honestâ€”most people don't want a new website.
They want a working website. One that shows up, loads fast, looks decent, and doesn't make people bounce before the page even finishes loading.

If you're here wondering if your site is the problem... you're not alone. I've worked with a lot of small business owners who've poured time (and money) into websites that don't actually help them.

So let's make this easy:

ðŸš¦Here are 6 signs your website might be holding you back:
1. You're not getting calls or emails from it.
This one's obvious, but I've got to say it. If no one is reaching out after visiting your site, it's not doing its job. Period.

2. Your site looks weird or broken on phones.
Over 60% of website visits happen on a phone now. If people have to pinch, zoom, or scroll sideways? They're gone.

3. It takes more than 3 seconds to load.
Your customers aren't waiting around. If it's slow, they bounceâ€”and you lose the sale before it even started.

4. It's not clear what you actually do.
This is big. If I land on your homepage and still don't know what you do in 5 seconds? That's a problem.

5. You haven't updated it in a year (or longer).
Outdated hours. Old menu. Broken links. No reviews or testimonials. These small things add up and quietly tell customers, "We might not be paying attention."

6. You feel embarrassed to send people to it.
You should be proud to link someone to your site. If you find yourself saying, "Don't judge it, it's old,"â€”then yeah, it's time.

So... do you need a new site?
If even two or three of those hit home, a redesign might seriously help you out.
Not a fancy, flashy siteâ€”just one that's fast, clear, and makes people feel like they can trust you with their money.
