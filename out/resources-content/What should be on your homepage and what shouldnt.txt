Your Homepage: The Make-or-Break First Impression
Here's the deal: Most people will spend less than 10 seconds on your homepage before deciding to stay or leave.

Ten seconds. That's all you get.

So let's make sure those seconds count. Here's exactly what should (and shouldn't) be on your small business homepage.

The Non-Negotiables: What Must Be There
1. What You Do (In Plain English)
Within 3 seconds, visitors should know:

What service/product you offer
Who you serve
Why they should care
Not: "Providing innovative solutions for diverse stakeholder needs"
But: "Plumbing repairs in North Haven - Same day service"

2. A Clear Call-to-Action (Above the Fold)
Tell people what to do next. One primary action:

"Book a Consultation"
"Get a Quote"
"Call Now"
"See Our Menu"
Make it a button. Make it obvious. Make it impossible to miss.

3. Your Phone Number (Clickable)
Top right corner. Always. Make it huge on mobile. People still want to call local businesses, especially for urgent needs.

4. Your Location/Service Area
If you're local, say it loud. "Serving North Haven and surrounding areas" tells both customers and Google exactly who you help.

5. Trust Signals
Within the first scroll, show:

Years in business
Number of customers served
Key certifications
Awards or recognition
A testimonial or two
Real proof, not generic claims.

6. Business Hours
Don't make people hunt. If you're closed when they visit, at least they know when to come back.

The Nice-to-Haves (If Space Allows)
Brief Service Overview
3-6 main services with links to learn more. Icons help. Keep descriptions to one line each.

Recent Work/Portfolio Snapshot
A few thumbnail images of your best work. Before/after photos are gold for service businesses.

Current Promotion
If you're running a special, mention it. But don't let it overshadow your main message.

Social Proof Logos
"As seen in" or "Trusted by" with recognizable local names or publications.

What to Leave OFF Your Homepage
Your Life Story
Save the full company history for the About page. Homepage visitors want to know what you can do for them NOW.

Stock Photos of Smiling Strangers
That generic "business handshake" photo? Everyone can tell it's fake. Use real photos of your actual business or skip it.

Industry Jargon
Write like you're explaining to a neighbor, not impressing a colleague. Plain language wins.

Autoplay Videos or Music
Just... don't. It's not 2010 anymore. People are browsing at work, in bed, in waiting rooms. Respect the silence.

Pop-ups That Block Content
If someone just arrived, don't immediately ask for their email. Let them see what you offer first.

Walls of Text
Break it up. Use:

Short paragraphs
Bullet points
Clear headings
White space
Too Many Options
More choices = more confusion. Stick to one primary action and maybe 2-3 secondary ones.

Mobile Considerations (Because That's Where They Are)
On phones, prioritize:

Click-to-call button
Your main service/product
One clear action button
Your location
Everything else can wait until they scroll.

The Homepage That Converts
A great homepage is like a good storefront:

Clean and inviting
Clear about what's inside
Easy to enter
Trustworthy at first glance
It's not about being clever or artistic. It's about being clear.

Quick Homepage Audit
Pull up your current homepage and ask:

Would my mom understand what we do in 5 seconds?
Can visitors contact us with one click?
Do we look trustworthy?
Is there a clear next step?
Does it work on phones?
If you answered "no" to any of these, you know what to fix.

The 80/20 Rule
80% of your visitors will never go past the homepage. Make it count.

Your homepage isn't a novel, a puzzle, or an art exhibit. It's a door. Make it easy to walk through.

Keep it simple. Keep it clear. Keep it focused on what matters to your customers.

Because in those crucial 10 seconds, clarity beats creativity every single time.
