Is Your Website Working For You or Against You?
Let's be real - most small business owners have no idea if their website is actually helping them get customers.

You probably built it (or had it built) years ago. It's "there." People can find it. But is it pulling its weight? Or is it the digital equivalent of a dusty storefront with the lights off?

Here's the truth: Your website is either making you money or losing you money. There's no in-between.

The Website Reality Check
Think about the last time you visited a business website and immediately clicked away. What made you leave?

Couldn't figure out what they actually did
Site looked sketchy or outdated
Took forever to load
Impossible to use on your phone
No clear way to contact them
Now here's the uncomfortable question: Are people doing that to YOUR site?

The 10 Signs of a Healthy Website
After building websites for years, I've noticed the successful ones all have these things in common:

1. Crystal Clear Purpose (5-Second Rule)
If someone can't figure out what you do in 5 seconds, you've already lost them. Your homepage should scream what you do, who you help, and why they should care.

2. Mobile-First Design
Over 70% of people browse on phones now. If they're pinching, zooming, or scrolling sideways, they're gone. Your competitors are just a tap away.

3. Lightning Fast Loading
Google says 53% of people abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load. Every extra second costs you customers.

4. Clickable Contact Info
People want to call you. Make it one tap. No hunting for phone numbers buried in footers or contact pages.

5. Real Photos of Real Work
Stock photos scream "generic." Show YOUR work, YOUR team, YOUR actual business. People buy from people they trust.

6. Local SEO Basics
If you're in North Haven but your site doesn't mention it, Google won't show you to local searchers. Simple fix, huge impact.

7. Fresh, Current Information
Nothing says "we don't care" like holiday hours from 2020 or a "Coming Soon" page that's been there for years.

8. Clear Calls to Action
Don't make people guess how to hire you. Big buttons. Clear next steps. "Book Now," "Get a Quote," "Call Today."

9. Google-Friendly Structure
If Google can't read your site, customers can't find you. Proper headings, descriptions, and structure matter.

10. Trust at First Sight
Would YOU trust this site with your credit card? If you hesitate, so will your customers.

The Cost of a Sick Website
Every day your website fails these basics, you're losing customers to competitors. Not because they're better - because their website works.

The worst part? You're probably spending money on ads, social media, and marketing to drive people to a site that's turning them away.

It's like paying for a billboard that points to an empty lot.

The Good News
Most website problems are surprisingly easy to fix. You don't need a $10,000 redesign. You need someone who knows what actually matters.

A few strategic changes can turn your site from a business card into a customer-generating machine.
