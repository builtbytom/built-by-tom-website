15:T13a4,<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Practical steps to take when you're stuck with a website that's not working for your business.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Share:
You Paid for a Website You Hate. Now What?
So you dropped a few thousand on a website, and now you can't stand looking at it. Maybe it looked great in the mockups. Maybe the designer convinced you it was exactly what you needed.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">But now? You avoid sending people to it. You mumble the URL. You know it's not helping your business, but you already paid for it.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">I see this all the time. Here's what you can actually do about it.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">First, Figure Out What's Really Wrong
Before you light it on fire and start over, let's get specific. Is it:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Just ugly? (Fixable)
Confusing to navigate? (Usually fixable)
Missing key information? (Easy fix)
Broken on phones? (Depends on the platform)
Not showing up on Google? (Almost always fixable)
Built on a platform you can't update? (Bigger problem)
Sometimes what feels like a total disaster just needs a few strategic fixes.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Check Your Contract (Seriously)
I know, nobody likes reading contracts. But check for:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Who owns the design files?
Do you have access to all accounts?
Are there any revision clauses?
What about hosting and domain ownership?
You'd be surprised how many people don't actually own their own website. If your designer holds the keys, you need those before doing anything else.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Don't Throw Good Money After Bad
Your first instinct might be to hire someone to "fix" it. But here's the thing - sometimes fixing a bad foundation costs more than starting fresh.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">It's like renovating a house with rotten beams. Sure, you can patch it up, but you'll be dealing with problems forever.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Ask yourself:
Will fixes solve the core problems?
Is the platform limiting what you can do?
Are you just postponing the inevitable?
Your Real Options
Option 1: Strategic Updates Only
If the bones are good but the execution is off, focus on high-impact changes:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Rewrite the homepage copy
Add clear calls-to-action
Fix mobile responsiveness
Update photos and branding
Improve load speed
Option 2: Work With What You've Got
Not ideal, but if money's tight:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Use it as a simple business card site
Drive traffic to your Google Business Profile instead
Focus on social media for now
Save up for a proper rebuild later
Option 3: Cut Your Losses and Start Fresh
If the site is actively hurting your business, it might be time to move on. A bad website is worse than no website.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The good news? You've learned what you DON'T want. That's valuable.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">How to Not Repeat This Mistake
Before you hire anyone else:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">1. See Their Real Work
Not just portfolio pieces. Real client sites. Click around. Use them on your phone. Would you trust these sites?</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">2. Get Everything in Writing
Who owns what
What's included
Revision policies
Timeline and milestones
3. Start Small
Consider starting with a simple, clean site you can build on. You don't need every bell and whistle on day one.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">4. Own Your Stuff
Your domain, hosting, design files - make sure you have access to everything. No exceptions.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The Silver Lining
That website you hate? It taught you exactly what you don't want. That's halfway to knowing what you do want.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Plus, web design has gotten better and cheaper. What cost $10,000 five years ago might cost $2,000 today - and work better.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Bottom Line
A bad website isn't a life sentence. You have options. The worst thing you can do is nothing - letting a terrible site turn away customers day after day.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Whether you fix it, work around it, or replace it, just don't let it sit there hurting your business. Your website should make you money, not cost you customers.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">And next time? You'll know exactly what questions to ask before you write the check.</p>7:["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-sage-light/10","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"relative bg-gradient-to-br from-primary via-slate-800 to-primary overflow-hidden","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute top-20 left-20 w-72 h-72 bg-secondary/20 rounded-full blur-3xl"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute bottom-20 right-20 w-96 h-96 bg-sage-light/20 rounded-full blur-3xl"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 pt-20 pb-16","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"href":"/resources","className":"inline-flex items-center text-white/80 hover:text-white mb-6 transition-colors","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 mr-2","fill":"none","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","stroke":"currentColor","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M15 19l-7-7 7-7"}]}],"Back to Resources"]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-display font-bold text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-white mb-8 leading-tight","children":"What to do if you already paid for a website you hate?"}]]}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 lg:py-16","children":[["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-16 p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5 to-secondary/5 rounded-2xl border border-primary/20","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-display font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4","children":"Ready to Fix Your Website & Systems?"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-text-light mb-6","children":"Let's discuss how I can help you build a website that works and systems that save you time."}],["$","$L6",null,{"href":"/contact","className":"inline-flex items-center bg-primary text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-primary/90 transition-all duration-200 shadow-lg","children":["Book a Free 15-min Call",["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 ml-2","fill":"none","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","stroke":"currentColor","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M9 5l7 7-7 7"}]}]]}]]}]]}]]}]
