<h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-foreground mb-6 mt-12">The Problem You Don't See Coming</h2>

<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">You're losing customers before they even call you, and you don't even know it's happening.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Here's what's going on: someone searches for "plumber near me" or "best restaurant in [your town]." Your business shows up in the results. They click on your Google Business Profile to learn more.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">And then they choose your competitor instead.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Not because their business is better. Not because their prices are lower. But because their Google Business Profile doesn't make them look like they went out of business in 2019.</p>

<h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-foreground mb-6 mt-12">What Your Customers See (And Why They Leave)</h2>

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Wrong Hours = Lost Sales</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What you think:</strong> "I'll update my hours when they change."

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What actually happens:</strong> Someone drives to your restaurant at 7 PM on a Tuesday. Google says you're open until 9. You actually close at 6. They're standing outside your locked door, frustrated, and they're never coming back.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The fix:</strong> Check your hours every month. Set them correctly for holidays. If you're closed for vacation, mark it on your profile.

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">No Photos = No Trust</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What you think:</strong> "People can see what we look like when they get here."

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What actually happens:</strong> People choose restaurants, salons, and service businesses based on photos. No photos means they assume you have something to hide.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The fix:</strong> Add real photos of your space, your team, your work. Not stock photos. Real ones. Even phone photos are better than nothing.

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Outdated Information = Professional Death</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What you think:</strong> "I set this up three years ago, it should be fine."

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What actually happens:</strong> Your phone number changed. Your address is wrong. Your services list is from 2020. People can't reach you, so they call your competitor instead.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The fix:</strong> Audit your profile every three months. Pretend you're a customer trying to contact you. Can you actually reach yourself?

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Generic Business Description = Invisible Business</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What you think:</strong> "Quality service since 1995."

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What actually happens:</strong> That tells customers nothing about what you actually do or why they should choose you.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The fix:</strong> Be specific. "Family-owned plumbing in North Haven. 24/7 emergency service, upfront pricing, licensed and insured." Now they know exactly what you offer.

<h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-foreground mb-6 mt-12">The Mistakes That Cost the Most Money</h2>

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Ignoring Reviews (Good and Bad)</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The mistake:</strong> Someone leaves a 1-star review saying your service was terrible. You ignore it because responding feels awkward.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">Why it's expensive:</strong> Everyone who reads that review sees that you don't care about your customers' experience.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What to do:</strong> Respond to every review. Thank people for good ones. Address concerns in bad ones professionally. Show that you actually care.

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Not Using Posts and Updates</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The mistake:</strong> Treating your Google Business Profile like a static business card.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">Why it's expensive:</strong> Google rewards active profiles with better visibility. Plus, customers want to see you're actually open and operating.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What to do:</strong> Post updates about new services, special offers, or even just "we're open and ready to help you today." Once a week is fine.

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl text-primary mb-4 mt-10 pb-2 border-b border-gray-100">Wrong Category Selection</h3>

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">The mistake:</strong> Picking a category that sounds more impressive than what you actually do.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">Why it's expensive:</strong> Google shows your business to people searching for things you don't actually offer.

<strong class="font-bold text-foreground">What to do:</strong> Pick the category that most accurately describes your primary service. You want the right customers, not more customers.

<h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-foreground mb-6 mt-12">How to Check If Yours Is Broken</h2>

<p class="text-xl text-text-light italic mb-8 leading-relaxed">*The 5-Minute Audit:*</p>

<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">1. Google your business name + your city</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">2. Look at your Google Business Profile like you're a potential customer</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">3. Call the phone number listed - does it work?</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">4. Check the address - is it correct?</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">5. Look at your hours - are they current?</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">6. Read your description - does it tell people what you actually do?</p>
<p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">7. Scroll through your photos - do they make you look professional?</p>

<p class="text-xl text-text-light italic mb-8 leading-relaxed">*Red flags that are costing you customers:*</p>
