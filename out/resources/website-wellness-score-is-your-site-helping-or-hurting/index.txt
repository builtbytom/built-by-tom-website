Is Your Website Working For You or Against You?
Let's be real - most small business owners have no idea if their website is actually helping them get customers.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">You probably built it (or had it built) years ago. It's "there." People can find it. But is it pulling its weight? Or is it the digital equivalent of a dusty storefront with the lights off?</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Here's the truth: Your website is either making you money or losing you money. There's no in-between.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The Website Reality Check
Think about the last time you visited a business website and immediately clicked away. What made you leave?</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Couldn't figure out what they actually did
Site looked sketchy or outdated
Took forever to load
Impossible to use on your phone
No clear way to contact them
Now here's the uncomfortable question: Are people doing that to YOUR site?</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The 10 Signs of a Healthy Website
After building websites for years, I've noticed the successful ones all have these things in common:</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">1. Crystal Clear Purpose (5-Second Rule)
If someone can't figure out what you do in 5 seconds, you've already lost them. Your homepage should scream what you do, who you help, and why they should care.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">2. Mobile-First Design
Over 70% of people browse on phones now. If they're pinching, zooming, or scrolling sideways, they're gone. Your competitors are just a tap away.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">3. Lightning Fast Loading
Google says 53% of people abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load. Every extra second costs you customers.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">4. Clickable Contact Info
People want to call you. Make it one tap. No hunting for phone numbers buried in footers or contact pages.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">5. Real Photos of Real Work
Stock photos scream "generic." Show YOUR work, YOUR team, YOUR actual business. People buy from people they trust.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">6. Local SEO Basics
If you're in North Haven but your site doesn't mention it, Google won't show you to local searchers. Simple fix, huge impact.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">7. Fresh, Current Information
Nothing says "we don't care" like holiday hours from 2020 or a "Coming Soon" page that's been there for years.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">8. Clear Calls to Action
Don't make people guess how to hire you. Big buttons. Clear next steps. "Book Now," "Get a Quote," "Call Today."</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">9. Google-Friendly Structure
If Google can't read your site, customers can't find you. Proper headings, descriptions, and structure matter.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">10. Trust at First Sight
Would YOU trust this site with your credit card? If you hesitate, so will your customers.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The Cost of a Sick Website
Every day your website fails these basics, you're losing customers to competitors. Not because they're better - because their website works.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The worst part? You're probably spending money on ads, social media, and marketing to drive people to a site that's turning them away.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">It's like paying for a billboard that points to an empty lot.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The Good News
Most website problems are surprisingly easy to fix. You don't need a $10,000 redesign. You need someone who knows what actually matters.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">A few strategic changes can turn your site from a business card into a customer-generating machine.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Want to Know Your Score?
I created a simple Website Wellness Assessment that tells you exactly where your site stands. No fluff, no tech speak - just straight answers about what's working and what's not.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">It takes 2 minutes, and you'll know immediately if your website is helping or hurting your business.</p><p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Because here's the thing: Your website should work as hard as you do. If it's not bringing in leads, booking appointments, or making sales, we need to fix that.</p>7:["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-sage-light/10","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"relative bg-gradient-to-br from-primary via-slate-800 to-primary overflow-hidden","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute top-20 left-20 w-72 h-72 bg-secondary/20 rounded-full blur-3xl"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute bottom-20 right-20 w-96 h-96 bg-sage-light/20 rounded-full blur-3xl"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 pt-20 pb-16","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"href":"/resources","className":"inline-flex items-center text-white/80 hover:text-white mb-6 transition-colors","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 mr-2","fill":"none","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","stroke":"currentColor","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M15 19l-7-7 7-7"}]}],"Back to Resources"]}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-display font-bold text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-white mb-8 leading-tight","children":"Website Wellness Score: Is your site helping or hurting?"}]]}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 lg:py-16","children":[["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-16 p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5 to-secondary/5 rounded-2xl border border-primary/20","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"font-display font-bold text-2xl text-foreground mb-4","children":"Ready to Fix Your Website & Systems?"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-text-light mb-6","children":"Let's discuss how I can help you build a website that works and systems that save you time."}],["$","$L6",null,{"href":"/contact","className":"inline-flex items-center bg-primary text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-primary/90 transition-all duration-200 shadow-lg","children":["Book a Free 15-min Call",["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 ml-2","fill":"none","viewBox":"0 0 24 24","stroke":"currentColor","children":["$","path",null,{"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":2,"d":"M9 5l7 7-7 7"}]}]]}]]}]]}]]}]
