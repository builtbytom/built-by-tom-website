    whyItHappens: "Most websites are built like brochures, not lead generation machines. Search engines don't understand what you do or where you serve customers.",
    whatYouNeed: [
      "Smart Local SEO: Your business shows up when people search '[your service] near me'",
      "Google Maps Integration: One-click directions that open right in their phone",
      "Review Management: Automatic requests for feedback from happy customers",
      "Local Authority Signals: Makes Google trust your location and services"
    ],
    realExample: "Carrie's cleaning service went from 2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week after we rebuilt her site with proper local SEO. She now dominates 'house cleaning near me' searches.",

    challenge: "People visit my site but don't call or buy anything",
    whyItHappens: "Most websites confuse visitors instead of guiding them. No clear path from 'just looking' to 'ready to buy.'",
    whatYouNeed: [
      "Psychology-First Design: Layout guides visitors naturally toward contacting you",
      "Trust Building Elements: Local credentials, real testimonials, clear expertise",
      "Mobile-Perfect Forms: Easy to fill out on phones, no typing frustration",
      "Smart Call-to-Actions: Clear next steps that reduce friction"
    ],
    realExample: "A contractor's old site got 100 visits but zero calls. New site converts 8-10 visitors into leads because it actually guides them to take action.",
    result: "Your website becomes a 24/7 salesperson that pre-qualifies leads and gets them excited to work with you"

      "Never Miss a Lead: Forms automatically send confirmations and alert you instantly",
      "Smart Follow-Up Sequences: Automatic emails that nurture leads while you work",
      "Unified Contact Flow: All inquiries organized in one place",
      "Built-in Reminder Systems: Never forget to follow up with warm leads"
    ],
    realExample: "Mike's contracting business was losing 30% of leads to poor follow-up. New website captures everything and reminds him who to call back. Revenue up 40% in 3 months.",
    result: "Every inquiry gets captured, confirmed, and followed up automatically - even when you're busy with paying customers"
  },

    id: 'looksbad',
    icon: 'üèöÔ∏è',
    challenge: "My current site looks unprofessional compared to competitors",
    whyItHappens: "Template sites all look the same, load slowly, and break on mobile devices. DIY efforts often look DIY.",
    whatYouNeed: [
      "Custom Design: Built specifically for your business, not from templates",
      "Premium Performance: Loads faster than 90% of websites (under 2 seconds)",
      "Mobile Excellence: Perfect experience on every device size",
      "Professional Polish: Typography, spacing, and details that convey competence"
    ],
    realExample: "A plumber's DIY site made him look like a hobbyist. Professional redesign had customers saying 'you must be the best plumber in town' before even meeting him.",
    result: "Your website makes competitors' sites look outdated and gives customers confidence before they even call"
  },

    challenge: "Managing appointments and scheduling is a nightmare",
    whyItHappens: "Phone tag, double-bookings, no-shows, and manual calendar management create chaos instead of smooth operations.",
    whatYouNeed: [
      "Booking Bliss: Online scheduling that syncs with your calendar automatically",
      "Smart Confirmations: Automatic texts and emails with all the details",
      "No-Show Prevention: Reminder sequences that keep appointments filled",
      "Buffer Management: Automatic spacing between appointments for travel/prep"
    ],
    realExample: "A massage therapist went from 25% no-shows to under 5% with automated reminders. Plus, clients love booking at midnight when they remember.",
    result: "Customers book themselves 24/7, show up prepared, and you never double-book or waste time on phone tag"

    challenge: "I have no idea if my website is actually working",
    whyItHappens: "Most websites are 'set it and forget it' with no tracking, analytics, or performance monitoring.",

      "Visitor Insights: See how customers find you and what they do on your site",
      "Conversion Monitoring: Track which pages turn visitors into customers",
      "ROI Documentation: Measure actual business impact of improvements"
