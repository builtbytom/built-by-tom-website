It's chasing no-shows, dealing with "can you fit my doodle in right now?" calls, and trying to text updates while wrestling a squirming poodle. Some days you feel like a groomer, a therapist, and an air traffic controller all at once. You got into this to make pets look amazing‚Äînot to spend half your day managing chaos.
