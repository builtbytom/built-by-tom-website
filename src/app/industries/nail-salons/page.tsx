              Running a nail salon isn't just about great nails. It's dealing with last-minute cancels, walk-in chaos, and "Can you fit me in at 5?" texts while you're trying to paint someone's pinky without smudging it. You work hard to build a vibe and keep clients happy. But if your booking system is held together with scotch tape and prayer, you're losing money and sanity every single day.
