              You became a coach or therapist to help people, not to write novels about what you do or play tech support with booking systems. But somehow you're spending more time explaining your process than actually doing it. I've worked with enough coaches and therapists to see the same pattern: great at what you do, but drowning in admin work that has nothing to do with actually helping people. And honestly? That stuff shouldn't be your job. Let me handle the tech headaches so you can get back to what you're passionate about.
